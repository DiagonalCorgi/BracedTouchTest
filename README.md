# BracedTouch Application

## Overview

The following application is built with the intention of improving and
 analysing braced-touch postures in a multitouch display. Each gesture platform
 runs off a braced detection engine, which is initiated during run time.
 
## How to run

Run the desired platform. To initiate, press the respective 'randomize' 
button on the top left of the screen. The first target should appear red.

## Drag

The user takes control of a circle at the center of the display. When a braced touch
is recognised, the circle will turn green. If the user drags the green circle over a 
red target, the target will turn green to indicate success.

## Scale

The user takes control of an arc at the left of the display. When a braced touch
is recognised, the arc will turn green. If the user scales the green circle to 
the corresponding target's value (as shown in the labels above) 
the target will turn green to indicate success.

## Rotate

The user takes control of an arc at the left of the display. When a braced touch
is recognised, the arc will turn green. If the user rotates the green circle to 
the corresponding target's value (as shown in the labels above) 
the target will turn green to indicate success.

## Logs

Each test has a respective log file that is generated. The log will contain important
 information about each test through a timeline of events.
